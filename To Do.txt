if there is nothing picked in the slot, there will be a zero entered into the nominations. 

if you do enter something there will be a number corresponding to the person/film that you chose. So
if I do not want to enter a film I will simply leave it blank, however, if I want to put in a nomination
to the best film category I will select Gravity. then, and i guess that i could do this a few ways, 
but I think that this is the best way, I will wait until the oscars are over and then i will simply 
compare the finished results with the winners ones, and then 














//Declare the submit value
//$submit = $_POST['submit'];
//echo "LOG: value of submit is ". $submit;
$firstname = strip_tags($_GET['nameField']);
echo "LOG: value of name is is ". $firstname;

$email = strip_tags($_GET['emailField']);
echo "LOG: value of email is ". $email;

//Make the connection to mysql
$con = mysql_connect("localhost","root","");
if (!$con)
{
	die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
}
var_dump($con);

mysql_select_db($mysql_name, $con);

//Check if username already exists
//$namecheck = mysql_query("SELECT username FROM users WHERE username='$username'");
//Create a count variable, if we successfully count 1 then username already exists
//$count = mysql_num_rows($namecheck);
/*if($count!=0)
{
	die("Username already exists...");
}
